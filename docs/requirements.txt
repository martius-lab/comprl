# The path to comprl needs to be relative to the repo root, otherwise the GitHub action
# for building/deploying the docs fails... (relative paths are relative to working
# direcotry, not relative to the requirements.txt...)
# So when using this file locally, you also need to call it from the repo's root
# directory.
