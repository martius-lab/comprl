-  Only used during runtime
-  There can be different players with the same User-ID

Matchmaking
===========

Principle
---------

-  Each player getâ€™s a rating consisting (mainly) of:

   -  a :math:`\mu` (``mu``) value: The average performance of the
      player
   -  a :math:`\sigma` (``sigma``) value: The uncertainty of the skill

-  ratings are used to predict outcomes of a game
-  updated after a game

Functionality
-------------

-  Agents joining are put in the queue
-  Fix percentage of online players are always waiting in queue
-  Every few seconds matchmaking is updated and possible matches are
   formed
-  match is suitable if:
   :math:`\textit{probability of a draw} + \textit{time bonus} > \textit{threshold}`
-  :math:`\textit{time bonus} = \textit{combined waiting time in min}\cdot \textit{0.1}`
-  after a match ``mu`` and ``sigma`` are updated based on score
