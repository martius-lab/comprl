********************
CompRL Web Interface
********************

``comprl-web-reflex`` contains a web interface implemented with Reflex_.  Through this
interface users can register, see the leaderboard and their game statistics, and
download the recorded data of their games.


Registration key
----------------

To be able to register, users have to provide a "registration key".  This is a simple
means to restrict registration to invited users.  The registration key is set in the
:ref:`server config file <server_config>`.  It is meant to be given to the people who
are allowed to take part in the competition, so they can create an account for
themselves.


Run the web interface for development
-------------------------------------

See the README in ``comprl-web-reflex`` for instructions on how to run the web
interface.
