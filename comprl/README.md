# COMPRL

## Description

**COMPRL** is a versatile Python package designed for hosting game-like competitions
among multiple remote clients. It's designed for easy and fast integration of new game
types.

## Installation

First install the non-Python requirements (they are not needed by comprl itself but by
the hockey package it depends on):
```
sudo apt install python3-dev swig
```

Then simply install via pip (best in a virtual environment):
```
pip install .
```


## Getting Started

### Initialize Database

Before being able to run the server for the first time, the database needs to be
initialized:
```sh
python -m comprl.scripts.create_database path/to/config.toml
```


### Server

To host your competition, implement a new game by inheriting from the `IGame` class
provided by the `comprl.server.interfaces` module. Once your game is fully implemented,
use a configuration file or command-line arguments to start the server with the desired
configuration.

```sh
#display all possible command line arguments
python -m comprl.server --h

#run server by providing a config file
python -m comprl.server --config="path/to/config.toml"
```

### Client

For implementing a new client, utilize the `comprl.client` package. Here, you can
directly instantiate an `Agent` object or inherit from it. The only required
implementation is the `get_step()` function, which is called with the corresponding
action. Additionally, override other functions to receive and handle data about games
being played or handle any errors that may occur. The flexibility provided by COMPRL
allows you to tailor the client to your specific needs.

## Examples

### Simple

This is a very simple game which checks is the sum of all received actions is greater
than 10, if so the game ends.
